Prerequisits:
-------------
- python 2.4 or higher
- pygtk
- pycairo

Requirements
-------------

Version 0.1 requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- i18n - prepare for gettext
- deployment (distutils. py2exe)
- recent files
- filechooser remembers recent location (separately for each context)
- properties (color scheme etc.) saved to user dir
- ability to display "note is present" mark/icon
- choose good icon (to be displayed as app icon in titlebar and in about dialog)
- icons instead of hardcoded pictograms in observation area

Other requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Undo/redo
- Locations, last files, window position, colrscheme should use system-transparent preferences API
  (gconf would be good, but too restrictive)

Errors / inconsequences
------------------------
- selected colorscheme is not saved (hence not loaded on next run)
- java-like observer pattern implemented instead of gobject signals (refactoring needed)
- fertility is not marked correctly (now only a mock-up)
- meaning of iconic pictures should be explained somewhere (icons should be displayed)
- a help file should be prepared
- temperature cannot be changed from keyboard; a day should be selectable from keyboard somehow
