After womoon is started, you see empty chart.

Each column represents one day and you can enter each day's temperature observation by either mouse-dragging of the blue dot up to the observed temp. value or by double-clicking the column, when day editor is shown.

As you enter everyday's data, the chart reflects the changes of your base body temperature, as you see on the example image below:

After you make your changes to the diagram, you can save it to the file system or/and export it to one of supported file formats:

  * .pdf
  * .png
  * .svg
  * .html (not yet supported)

You can also change the colour scheme of the chart by editing the properties (which can also be saved to file).
